ProductDetection_RetailDash

My Project Overview:
I developed this project to transform supermarket shelf images into visual dashboards by combining Computer Vision with AI-based sales analysis. It showcases        how image processing (OpenCV) and business insights from CSV data can work together to detect products and track their sales patterns efficiently.

Key Features:

Initially I Cleaned the Dataset and prepared tabular data using pandas.
Visualized stock patterns alongside sales data.
Detected products using contour analysis from real shelf images.
Then I Mapped image insights (like stock levels) with product sales trends.
Applied filters to highlight key patterns in stock vs. performance.

Tools Used:

Python, Google Colab.
OpenCV for Image Processing.
Pandas, NumPy for data analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for dashboard plotting.
GitHub for version control and portfolio showcase.

Project Outcome:
AI Business powered DashBoard that helps me to detect the objects/products from images that aligns with the Actual supermarket sales data.
